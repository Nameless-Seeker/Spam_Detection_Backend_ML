Scam Call Detection — Audio Feature Extraction Pipeline
========================================================
Aligned to architecture diagram:

  Stage 1 → Rolling Buffer (5-sec windows, in-memory, no storage)
  Stage 2 → Voice Activity Detection (removes silence & non-speech)
  Stage 3a → MFCC Feature Extraction     → feeds Phoneme CNN model
  Stage 3b → Prosody Feature Extraction  → feeds Urgency/Prosody MLP model

Dataset expected at:
  processed_dataset/
    NORMAL_CALLS/   *.wav   → label 0
    SCAM_CALLS/     *.wav   → label 1

Outputs saved to:
  features/
    NORMAL_CALLS/
      mfcc_<filename>_<window>.npy        shape: (T, 120)  ← CNN input
      prosody_<filename>_<window>.npy     shape: (11,)     ← MLP input
